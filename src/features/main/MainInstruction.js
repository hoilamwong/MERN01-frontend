          The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.[1] It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.[2][1]
        </span>
      )
    } else if (clicked === "How to Use") {
      content = (
        <span>
          The original technique has six steps:

          Decide on the task to be done.
          Set the Pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).[1]
          Work on the task.
          End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5â€“10 minutes).[4]
          Go back to Step 2 and repeat until you complete four pomodoros.
          After four pomodoros are done, take a long break (typically 20 to 30 minutes) instead of a short break. Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.
          For the purposes of the technique, a pomodoro is an interval of work time.[1]
